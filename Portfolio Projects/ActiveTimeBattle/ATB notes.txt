What needs to be made

Battle actor
-Bool for player controlled actor
-ATB bar that fills over time
-Stats variables
-Death state
-If player controlled, UI appears over actor
-else, attacks random player controlled actor

Battle system
-All battle actors atb bars fill at constant rate
-During basic attack animations, atb bars continue to fill
-Special attacks pause atb bars 
-When any attack is confirmed, it gets added to the end of an attack queue
	-Limit attacks can skip the queue and instantly be performed after the current attack animation is finished
	-If two limit attacks are in the queue, it prioritizes the most recently used limit attack
